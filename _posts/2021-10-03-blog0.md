Let's make a visualization for the Palmer Penguin dataset!

## Preparation
### Inspect Raw Data
Let's read the raw data first: 
```python
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```
Now we have a pandas dataframe of the penguins data. Let's take a look at this dataframe: 
```python
penguins
```

### Before We Start
**_First_**, let's choose the features that we want to plot.\
I decided to plot Culmen Length and Flipper Length. 

**_Second_**, let's think about how we want this visualization to look like.\
I want to do a scatter plot for each row (representing each penguin in the sample), and use different colors and shapes to distinguish different penguins. And I want to use Culmen Length as the x-axis, Flipper Length as the y-axis.

**_Third_**, let's choose what package to use for the plotting.\
Since I want to plot 2 columns at a time, and seperate the data based on penguin species, I decided to use the package <span style="text-decoration: underline">seaborn</span> for visualization.

## Data Cleaning
Let's clean the data first according to our plan.

### Choose Columns
We write a list of the columns we need, and create a new dataframe with only these columns.
```python
cols = ["Species", "Culmen Length (mm)", "Flipper Length (mm)"]
df = penguins[cols]
```

### Edit Columns
The texts in the Species column seems too long for us to read. We only need the first word for each entry, and we can use the **.str** keyword to achieve that:
```python
df["Species"] = df["Species"].str.split().str.get(0)
```

### Drop Empty Rows
Let's drop the rows with "Nan" values: 
```python
df = df.dropna()
```

### Inspect Cleaned Data
Now let's take a look at the cleaned dataframe: 
```python
df
```

## Plot
First import seaborn and set theme.
```python
import seaborn as sn
sn.set_theme()
```

Now we can plot with seaborn!
```python
g = sn.lmplot(
    data=df,			# the data to plot
    x="Culmen Length (mm)", 	# choose x-axis
    y="Flipper Length (mm)", 	# choose y-axis
    hue="Species",		# choose how to separate the dots
    height=5			# choose plot height
)

# Set title and axis labels
g.set(title="Palmer Penguins", xlabel="Culmen Length (mm)", ylabel="Flipper Length (mm)")
```

Now we're done with the visualization! Feel free to leave a comment below if you have any question/sugeestions.
